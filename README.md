## Overview

The Loan Approval Classifier is a Flask-based web application designed to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for approval. By analyzing various applicant data features such as income, education, and credit history, the model provides an accurate prediction of loan approval, helping financial institutions streamline the decision-making process and minimize risk.

## Features

- **Data Input:** Enter applicant details through a user-friendly web form.
- **Loan Approval Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts whether a loan application will be approved.
- **Data Analysis:** Visual insights into the applicant data used for model training.
- **Responsive UI:** A mobile-friendly interface for seamless user experience across devices.

## Video Demonstration

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Input applicant details in the form provided.
3. Submit to receive the loan approval prediction.

## Model and Methodology

The model was trained on a loan applicant dataset using several machine learning algorithms. After evaluating different models, the most accurate one was selected for deployment. The process involved feature scaling, categorical encoding, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
